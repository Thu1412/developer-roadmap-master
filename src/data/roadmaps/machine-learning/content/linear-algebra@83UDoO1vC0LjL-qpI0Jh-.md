# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and linear transformations between those spaces. It involves concepts like vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations, and provides tools for manipulating and solving problems involving these entities. Operations such as matrix multiplication, decomposition, and eigenvalue analysis are fundamental to this field.
