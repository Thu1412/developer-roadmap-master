It can be used in AI character behaviors, UI systems, or game-level states. State Machines keep the code organized and manageable, making it easier for developers to implement complex game logic.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@article@State Machines in Games](https://gamedev.net/tutorials/_/technical/game-programming/state-machines-in-games-r2982/)\n",
    "stencil-shadow@AEAVc8Ih4fctSGGVJG0Np": "# Stencil Shadow\n\n`Stencil shadows` are a technique used in 3D computer graphics for creating shadows. The stencil shadow algorithm operates by treating a shadow as a 3D volume of space, known as a shadow volume. Any part of the scene that lies inside this shadow volume will be in shadow. If it lies outside the shadow volume, it will be in light. The shadow volume is created by extruding the polygonal silhouette of a 3D object into space along the lines of sight from the light source. For equivalent complex objects, the number of edges or vertices to fill the stencil buffer will generally be less than the number of pixels needed to compute shadow maps, making stencil shadows more efficient in that regard. However, the shadows produced by this technique can look blocky or unrealistic if not further refined.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@article@Stencil Shadows Implementation](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/stencil-shadows-implementation/2079287)\n",
    "texture@iBZ1JsEWI0xuLgUvfWfl-": "# Texture\r\n\r\n`Texture` is the visual quality of an object. Where the `mesh` determines the shape or `topology` of an object, the texture describes the quality of said object. For instance, if there is a spherical mesh, is it supposed to be shiny? is it supposed to be rough? is it supposed to be of rock or of wood? questions of this ilk are often resolved using textures. Textures are often just 2D images that are wrapped onto 3D meshes. The 3D mesh is first divided into segments and unfurled; the 3D meshes are converted into 2D chunks, this process is known as `UV Unwrapping`. Once a mesh has been unwrapped, the textures in the form of an image are applied to the 2D chunks of the 3D mesh, this way the texture knows how to properly wrap around the mesh and avoid any conflicts. Textures determine the visual feel and aesthetics of the game.\r\n\r\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\r\n\r\n- [@article@Textures and Materials](https://gamedevinsider.com/making-games/game-artist/texturing-and-materials/)\r\n- [@video@How Nintendo Textures Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCMzHngLxI)\r\n- [@video@How Pixar Textures work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_I6jxlN-Ck)\r\n",
    "tone-reproduction@RgC9TOc0wbr2QSuvrpIDV": "# Tone Reproduction\n\n`Tone Reproduction` or `Tone Mapping` is the technique used in computer graphics to simulate the appearance of high-dynamic-range images in media with a more limited dynamic range. Print-outs, CRT, LCD monitors, and other displays can only reproduce a reduced dynamic range. This technique is widely used in gaming development, where developers employ it to improve the visual experience. The process involves taking light from a scene and mapping it to a smaller range of tones while preserving the visual appearance—i.e., regarding brightness, saturation, and hue. There are various tone mapping algorithms available, each with unique attributes suitable for different imaging tasks.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@article@Tone Mapping](https://graphics-programming.org/resources/tonemapping/index.html)\n- [@article@Sound Design for Video Games](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sound-design-for-video-games-a-primer)\n",
    "translucency--transparency@PuhXaRZ-Ql5PCqzMyz3en": "# Conservation of Energy\n\nIn the realm of physically-based rendering, **translucency** and **transparency** act as key aspects in creating visually authentic and compelling images. Transparency refers to the property of an object that allows light to pass through it unhindered, hence making the object clear or invisible. This is commonly seen in materials such as glass, clear plastic, and water. On the other hand, translucency describes how light interacts with a semi-transparent object. Instead of passing directly through, light enters the object, travels within for some distance and then exits at a different location. Common examples of such surfaces include human skin, marble, milk, or wax, which exhibit a soft, diffused lighting effect when light rays pass through them. The technique to achieve this effect in graphics involves subsurface scattering, where incoming light is scattered beneath the object's surface, illuminated it in a way that showcases the material's internal structure.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@article@Learn OpenGL - Blending](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Blending)\n",
