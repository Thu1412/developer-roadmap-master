    "venom@3HCpgWWPIkhK3gPRJuJQf": "# Venom\n\nThe Venom Foundation is the first crypto foundation licensed in UAE's ADGM and is set to launch its blockchain platform soon. The platform uses asynchronous blockchain technology of dynamical sharding, which enables boundless scalability, higher security guarantees with decentralization, and manages the gross data transaction flows without faltering by increasing fees and transaction times. The foundation aims to develop and support a self-sufficient blockchain ecosystem with non-custodial wallet options, transparent transaction histories, interchain transactions, staking on validator nodes, and a native decentralized exchange, among others.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Venom](https://venom.foundation)\n- [@official@Venom Documentation](https://docs.venom.foundation/)\n- [@official@Venom Whitepaper](https://venom.foundation/Venom_Whitepaper.pdf)\n- [@official@Venom Explore Grants](https://venom.foundation/#explore_grants)\n",

    "why-it-matters@ecT4W5z8Vq9pXjnuhMdpl": "# Why it matters\n\nThe nature of blockchain allows for trustless systems to be built on top of it. Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons. This decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@article@Why Blockchain?](https://chain.link/education-hub/blockchain)\n- [@article@Web3/Crypto: Why Bother?](https://continuations.com/post/671863718643105792/web3crypto-why-bother)\n- [@article@Why is Blockchain Important and Why Does it Matter](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/blockchain-tutorial/why-is-blockchain-important)\n- [@video@Cyfirn Updraft | The Purpose of Smart Contracts](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics/basics/the-purpose-of-smart-contracts)\n- [@feed@Explore top posts about Blockchain](https://app.daily.dev/tags/blockchain?ref=roadmapsh)\n",
