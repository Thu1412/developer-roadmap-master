Generally, the main focus is on the worst-case scenario which represents the maximum number of steps taken by an algorithm.

These algorithms use random numbers to make decisions, and thus, even for the same input, can produce different outcomes on different executions. The correctness of these algorithms are probabilistic and they are particularly useful when dealing with a large input space. There are two major types of randomised algorithms: Las Vegas algorithms, which always give the correct answer, but their running time is a random variable; and Monté Carlo algorithms, where the algorithm has a small probability of viability or accuracy.\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@video@Algorithm Classification Randomized Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_EVG6yCOz0)\n",
    "recursion@4ZAzcwP0oPGZ9Rw042V8-": "# Recursion\n\nRecursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to shorter instances of the same problem. It involves a function calling itself while having a condition for its termination. This technique is mostly used in programming languages like C++, Java, Python, etc. There are two main components in a recursive function: the base case (termination condition) and the recursive case, where the function repeatedly calls itself. All recursive algorithms must have a base case to prevent infinite loops. Recursion can be direct (if a function calls itself) or indirect (if the function A calls another function B, which calls the first function A).\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@video@Recursion in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf60MejMz3E)\n",

The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program.
