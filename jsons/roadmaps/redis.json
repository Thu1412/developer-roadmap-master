In this system, publishers send messages to specific channels without knowing who, if anyone, will receive them. Subscribers, on the other hand, express interest in particular channels and receive messages published to those channels instantly. This decouples the message producers from the consumers, facilitating flexible and scalable communication. Key commands in this model include `PUBLISH` for sending messages, `SUBSCRIBE` for listening to channels, and `UNSUBSCRIBE` for stopping the reception of messages.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Pub/Sub in Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/pubsub/)\n",

It is faster for startup since it loads a single file and consumes less disk I/O during normal operations. However, it may lead to data loss between snapshots if the server crashes, as changes made during that interval are not saved.\n\n**AOF**, on the other hand, logs every write operation in real-time, allowing for more granular recovery with minimal data loss, as you can replay commands to reconstruct the dataset. This comes at the cost of increased disk I/O and potential performance overhead, especially with frequent write operations. The AOF file can also grow significantly, requiring periodic rewriting to optimize size.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@official@RDB Advantages](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence/#rdb-advantages)\n- [@official@AOF Advantages](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence/#aof-advantages)\n- [@article@AOF vs RDB, Which One to Choose?](https://codedamn.com/news/backend/redis-data-persistence-aof-vs-rdb)",

It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, making it highly versatile. Redis operates with extremely low latency due to its in-memory nature, enabling fast access to data. It is often used in real-time applications such as session management, leaderboards, or caching mechanisms, where quick data retrieval is critical. Additionally, Redis supports data persistence by periodically writing the dataset to disk, balancing memory speed with data reliability.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@What is Redis?](https://redis.io/docs/latest/get-started/)\n- [@official@Introduction to Redis](https://redis.io/about/)\n- [@article@Redis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis)\n- [@article@What is Redis Explained? - IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/redis)",
