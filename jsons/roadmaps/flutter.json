The widget that is being animated should have a unique tag property so that Flutter can match the source and destination widgets. Hero widgets are used for visual continuity between screens, so when the user navigates from one screen to another, the hero widget smoothly transitions to its new position instead of abruptly appearing or disappearing. This can make the navigation between screens feel more seamless and enjoyable for the user.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Hero Animations](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/animations/hero-animations)\n- [@article@HeroAnimation class](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/animations/hero-animations#heroanimation-class)\n",

The child widget is drawn with the specified opacity, making it appear translucent or transparent, depending on the value of the opacity argument. This can be useful for creating visual effects such as fading in or out, or to create partially transparent backgrounds or overlays. By using Opacity in combination with other widgets and animations, you can create sophisticated visual effects in your Flutter app.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Fade a Widget in and out](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/animation/opacity-animation)\n- [@article@AnimatedOpacity widget](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs/implicit-animations#animate-opacity-with-animatedopacity-widgets)\n"

There are several ways to add an image to your app:\n\n- Asset: Add the image to your app's assets and specify the asset path in the `Image` widget.\n- Network: Display an image from a URL by specifying the URL in the `Image` widget.\n- File: Display an image from a file by specifying the file path in the `Image` widget.\n\nThe `Image` widget also accepts additional parameters such as `fit`, `width`, and `height` to control the size and scaling of the image.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Adding Assets and Images](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/assets-and-images)\n- [@article@Images in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/images)\n",
      "index": "# Working with Assets\n\nAssets are resources such as images, fonts, and other files that are included in your app. To use assets in Flutter, you need to specify them in your app's `pubspec.yaml` file and then access them in your code.\n\nThe `pubspec.yaml` file is used to manage dependencies, assets, and other settings in your Flutter app. The `flutter` section is used to specify assets that should be included with the app. The path specified in the `assets` section should be relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@official@Adding Assets in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/assets-and-images)\n- [@video@Flutter Tutorial - Assets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxh6nNHSUjo)\n",
      "other-file-types": "# Other File Types\n\nIn Flutter, you can work with different file types besides images. Some common file types that you can use in Flutter include:\n\n1. Text files: You can read or write text files using the dart:io library.\n2. JSON files: You can parse JSON data using the dart:convert library.\n3. Audio and Video files: You can play audio and video files using the video_player and audioplayers packages.\n4. PDF files: You can display PDF files using the pdf package.\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@official@File Class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-io/File-class.html)\n"
