Meanwhile, `gzip` and `bzip2` are used for file compression, reducing the file size and making data transmission easier.\n\nTake a look at the following commands in use:\n\n```bash\n# To create a tar archive:\ntar cvf archive_name.tar directory_to_archive/\n\n# To extract a tar archive:\ntar xvf archive_name.tar\n\n# To create a gzip compressed tar archive:\ntar cvzf archive_name.tar.gz directory_to_archive/\n\n#To create a bzip2 compressed tar archive:\ntar cvjf archive_name.tar.bz2 directory_to_archive/\n```\n\nRemember, in Linux, archiving and compression are separate processes, hence `tar` to archive and `gzip`/`bzip2` to compress.
