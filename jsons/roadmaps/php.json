Here, `$intVar` would be an integer representation of `$myVar`. Remember, the original variable type remains unchanged. \n\nHere's an example of type casting in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$foo = 10;   // $foo is an integer\n$bar = (bool) $foo;   // $bar is a boolean\n?>\n```\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Type Casting](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php)",

A static method is declared with the static keyword and can be invoked directly using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator. Similarly, a static property is also defined with the static keyword, but cannot be accessed directly, even from within the class methods - they must be accessed through static methods. Here's a simple example: \n\n```php\nclass MyClass {\n    static $myStaticProperty = \"Hello, world\";\n\n    static function myStaticMethod() { \n        return self::$myStaticProperty; \n    }\n}\n\necho MyClass::myStaticMethod(); \n```\n\nIn this example, we're directly accessing `myStaticMethod` from `MyClass` without an instantiation.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Static Methods and Properties](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php)\n",

PHP_CodeSniffer is a popular tool in this category. It tokenizes PHP, JavaScript, and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards. A brief example of PHP_CodeSniffer usage would be to run it in the command line like this: `phpcs /path/to/code/myfile.php`. Other tools such as PHP CS Fixer can automatically correct coding standard violations.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Style Tools](https://www.php.net/manual/en/refs.basic.php.cs.php)\n",
    "switch@bgJ9-m6Fiu3VCc-NZlbpn": "# switch\n\nThe switch statement is a special conditional statement in PHP that can simplify code and improve readability when you need to compare one value with multiple different possibilities. It is an alternative to using a chain of \"if...else\" conditions, and is particularly useful when you have many different cases to compare. The switch expression is evaluated only once, and its value is compared to each case. When a match is found, PHP executes the associated code block. \n\nHere's a basic switch statement:\n\n```php\n$fruit = \"apple\";\nswitch ($fruit) {\n  case \"apple\":\n    echo \"You chose apple.\";\n    break;\n  case \"banana\":\n    echo \"You chose banana.\";\n    break;\n  default:\n    echo \"Invalid choice.\";\n}\n// Outputs: You chose apple.\n```\n\nSwitch statements can make your code cleaner and easier to manage, especially when dealing with multiple conditions. \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@switch](https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php)\n",

Not only does it help to debug code quickly, it also makes the code more readable. In PHP, type declarations can be for both parameters in a function (parameter type declarations) and return values from a function (return type declarations). They can apply to classes, interfaces, callable, and scalar types (int, float, string, bool). \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```php\nfunction add(int $a, int $b): int {\n    return $a + $b;\n}\n\necho add(1, 2);  // prints: 3\n```\nIn this example, the function 'add' only accepts integers and also returns an integer.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Type Declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration)\n",

Local scope refers to variables that are only accessible within the function they are defined, while global scope means a variable is accessible to any part of the script. However, to use a global variable inside a function, you need to declare it as global. Here's a brief example: \n\n```php\n$x = 10; //global variable\nfunction test() {\n    global $x; // accessing the global variable\n    echo $x;\n}\ntest(); //prints 10\n```\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Variables and Scope](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php)\n",
