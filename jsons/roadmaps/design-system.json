This can be done with placeholder images or initials.\n- **Accessibility:** Always provide a description for screen readers describing what’s displayed on the avatar image instead of just naming its role.\n- **Sizes:** There are many contexts to use avatars and they all require different sizes for the component. For average projects use at least 2-3 different sizes and make sure there’s at least a small size available.\n- **Icon:** Avatars can be used with an icon instead of an image to emphasize areas that don’t necessarily have (or need) an image associated with it.\n- **Background Colors:** When used with icons or text, there has to be a background colour from the design system colour tokens applied to the avatar shape.

That may be either a separate close button or one of the actions provided.\n- **Accessibility:** If a banner dynamically appears on the page, it should be announced to the user by their assistive technology.\n- **Responsiveness:** Banners should adapt to the viewport size.

Make sure that the accessibility label is provided when used with an icon only.\n- **Disabled:** Visually shows that a button is not interactive and restricts it from being pressed.\n- **Loading:** Used when users have to wait for the result of their action after they press a button. If a spinner is used to display this state make sure that it’s not changing the original button width or height.\n- **Full Width:** By default buttons take the width of their content, but they should also come with a full width variant that works well in mobile devices.\n- **Variants:** When using multiple buttons, there should be a way to differentiate between primary and secondary actions. Buttons may play different roles for the user or be used on different types of surfaces and they have to change the way they look.\n- **Sizes:** Buttons can be used in different areas of the website and may have multiple predefined sizes.

The most popular options are having a full-width area on top of the content or full-height area at one of the card’s sides.\n- **Supplementary actions:** Cards can be used with actions usually placed at the bottom of the card, or the card itself can be tappable and represent an action.\n- **Responsiveness:** On mobile viewports cards are usually full-width in order to save space for the content.\n",

For more flexibility, it’s good to provide a way to define a custom width.\n- **Touch events support:** Carousels should be scrollable on touch devices. Some of the best practices are to use native scrolling and to make sure you’re supporting the same behaviour for all touch devices, not just mobile phones.\n- **Keyboard navigation:** It should be possible to scroll through content with keyboard arrows when focused on navigation controls.\n- **Responsiveness:** It’s good practice to hide or reduce the size of navigation controls for mobile viewports to improve the visibility of the content.\n",
