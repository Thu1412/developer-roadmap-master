Here are some of my recommendations for your GitHub profile:\n\n- Keep the repository names lowercase and use hyphens to separate words e.g. `todo-app` instead of `TodoApp` or `Todo-App`.\n- Add a `README.md` file to each repository that you create. This file should contain a description of the project. Put some effort into the readme and make sure it clearly details what the project is about and how anyone can run it locally.\n- Add snapshots of your project to the readme file so that anyone can see what the project looks like without having to run it locally.\n- Add a `LICENSE` file to each repository that you create. This file should contain the license that you want to use for the project. You can use [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.\n\nYou can have a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kamranahmedse) and see how I have structured my repositories and how [some of my readme files look like](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/aws-cost-cli).\n",

You can use [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) to get the current time and display it on the page. Here is the [sample design for homepage](https://i.imgur.com/yGIMGkr.png).\n- Install the [micromodal](https://micromodal.vercel.app/#introduction) library.

Apart from coding along with the instructor:\n  - Try to build the same project at least 2 to 3 times on your own without looking at the video.

They write code and, most of the time, also take care of everything required to push the product into production.\n\n    Full stack developers (also known as full stack web developers) will usually have the required skills to tackle any part of the web development process. In the front end, they'll focus on building the user interface using technologies such as HTML, [JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript), and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets - usually mixed with some UI framework such as React or Vue). For the back-end side of these projects, they will code the business logic and any type of data access required involving either some [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql) database or, in some projects, noSQL options. As part of the back-end, there might also be some API design involved, as well as other performance and scalability optimizations that need to be performed.\n\n    As a summary, you could say that a full stack developer is a \"jack of all trades\" when it comes to web development. While they might not always be the absolute experts in any of those technologies, they're more than capable of filling any gaps in the team.\n\n    ## What languages are used in Full Stack Development?\n\n    In full stack development, the languages used can range from just 3 to a multitude of options.\n\n    For the front-end there aren't that many options; you can only use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the freedom of picking the framework that best suits your preferences). However, on the back-end, the story is quite different. Of course, you can pick JavaScript, keeping the full tech stack homogenous, but you also have the option to add multiple programming languages if you're going with a microservices-based architecture, using the right language for each service. If that's your situation, some of the most popular languages include [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python), Ruby, [Java](https://roadmap.sh/java), [PHP](https://roadmap.sh/php), or [C#](https://roadmap.sh/aspnet-core).\n\n    And to top it all out, you'll often use something like SQL (Structured Query Language) for your database interactions (unless you're going with a NoSQL database).\n\n    ## What skills do I need to become a Full Stack Developer?\n\n    To become a full stack developer, the skills you'll need are very varied. You'll need to understand both front-end and back-end software development, including some of the most popular frameworks and libraries.\n\n    That means you'll have to know how to turn designs into good user interfaces following the latest UX trends. In the back-end, you'll need to grasp server-side programming, work with databases, manage APIs, and ensure that everything integrates as it should. And you'll do all of that as part of your regular development process.\n\n    On top of all of this, other key full stack developer skills that would enhance your profile are version control systems (such as Git which is the current industry standard) and understanding RESTful APIs.\n\n    Of course, strong problem-solving abilities, debugging skills, and a willingness to continuously learn new technologies are also crucial for this role, like they are for any software development job.\n\n    In the end, this particular blend of skills allows developers to build full-featured web applications from start to finish.\n\n    ## How do I become a Full Stack Developer?\n\n    To become a full stack developer, you need to start by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they will give you everything you need to master front-end development.\n\n    Once you're ready, you can then pick up a back-end language such as Python or Java (or even JavaScript again through Node.js). Try to start small and build a simple back-end for your website. A good idea here is to pick up a full stack framework, such as NextJS or Django; they will make it easy for you to integrate the back-end into your project. Slowly start introducing database management into the mix. This will open up the door to more complex applications. Just remember to start with small projects to practice your full stack developer skills and gradually work on more complex ones.\n\n    As a long-term learning plan, creating a portfolio to showcase your progress can be a great motivator. Consider following roadmaps like the [full stack roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack), and keep learning through online courses or bootcamps to boost your journey into full stack development.\nschema:\n  headline: 'Full Stack Developer Roadmap'\n  description: 'Learn how to become a Full Stack Developer with this interactive step by step guide in 2025.
