Each subnet has its own range of IP addresses, which allows network administrators to optimize network traffic and reduce congestion by isolating different sections of a network. In subnetting, an IP address is split into two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The network portion identifies the overall network, while the host portion identifies individual devices within that network. Subnet masks are used to define how much of the IP address belongs to the network and how much is reserved for hosts. By adjusting the subnet mask, administrators can create multiple subnets from a single network, with each subnet having a limited number of devices.

FTP is an older protocol that transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. It typically uses separate connections for commands and data transfer, operating on ports 20 and 21. SFTP, on the other hand, is a secure version that runs over the SSH protocol, encrypting both authentication credentials and file transfers. It uses a single connection on port 22, providing better firewall compatibility. SFTP offers stronger authentication methods and integrity checking, making it the preferred choice for secure file transfers in modern networks. While FTP is simpler and may be faster in some scenarios, its lack of built-in encryption makes it unsuitable for transmitting sensitive information, leading many organizations to adopt SFTP or other secure alternatives to protect their data during transit.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@article@FTP defined and explained](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/file-transfer-protocol-ftp-meaning)\n- [@video@How to use SFTP commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22lBJIfO9qQ)\n",

Impacts can be financial, reputational, operational, or any other negative consequence that your organization faces as a result of a security breach.\n\nWhen evaluating the risk levels of a cybersecurity scenario, it is important to assess the likelihood of a specific threat exploiting a specific vulnerability, as well as the associated impact if such an event occurs. By understanding risks and their components, you can better prioritize your security resources and take appropriate steps to mitigate potential risks. Remember that risk cannot be entirely eliminated, but rather managed to an acceptable level through effective security measures and strategies.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@article@What is Cybersecurity Risk?](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/what-is-cybersecurity-risk-factors-to-consider/)\n- [@video@Risk Analysis - Know Your Threat Tolerance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt_Cdtvjbd4)\n",

It offers scalability, flexibility, and often lower upfront costs. Users can access resources on-demand and pay for what they use. Cloud solutions provide easier remote access and automatic updates but may raise data security and compliance concerns. On-premises (or on-prem) refers to installing and running software on computers and servers located within an organization's physical premises. This approach offers more direct control over data and systems, potentially better performance for certain applications, and can address specific regulatory requirements. However, it typically requires higher upfront investment, ongoing maintenance, and may be less scalable than cloud solutions. Many organizations now adopt hybrid approaches, combining both cloud and on-premises solutions to balance their specific needs for control, cost-efficiency, and flexibility.\n\nLearn more of the following resources:\n\n- [@article@What is On-Premises Data Centers vs. Cloud Computing?](https://www.hpe.com/uk/en/what-is/on-premises-vs-cloud.html)\n- [@video@On Premise vs Cloud : Is Cloud Computing the future?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPh2o-GMDA)",
