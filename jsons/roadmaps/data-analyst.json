It aids in summarizing, structuring, and plotting structured data graphically to provide essential insights. This includes using different chart types like bar graphs, histograms, and scatter plots for interval data, and pie or bar graphs for categorical data. Ultimately, the aim is to provide a straightforward and effective manner to comprehend the data's characteristics and underlying structure. A data analyst uses these visualisation techniques to make initial conclusions, detect anomalies, and decide on further analysis paths.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@video@Visualising Distributions in Power BI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOemr3sz2vw)\n- [@article@Data Visualizations that Capture Distributions](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-demystified-data-visualizations-that-capture-distributions)",

This is where basic functions like vlookup and hlookup in Excel become extremely useful. These functions are versatile lookup and reference functions that can find specified data in a vast array, providing ease and convenience in data retrieval tasks.\n\nThe Vertical Lookup (vlookup) is used to find data in a table sorted vertically, while the Horizontal Lookup (hlookup) is used on data organized horizontally. Mastering these functions is crucial for any data analyst's toolbox, as they can dramatically speed up data access, reduce errors in data extraction, and simplify the overall process of analysis. In essence, these two functions are not just basic functions; they serve as essential tools for efficient data analysis.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@article@VLOOKUP Function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1)\n- [@article@HLOOKUP Function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/hlookup-function-a3034eec-b719-4ba3-bb65-e1ad662ed95f)",

In the realm of a data analyst's tasks, web scraping refers to the method of extracting information from websites and converting it into a structured usable format like a CSV, Excel spreadsheet, or even into databases. This technique allows data analysts to gather large sets of data from the internet, which otherwise could be time-consuming if done manually. The capability of web scraping and parsing data effectively can give data analysts a competitive edge in their data analysis process, from unlocking in-depth, insightful information to making data-driven decisions.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@article@What is Web Scraping & What is it used for?](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/what-is-web-scraping/)\n- [@video@What is Web Scraping?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlj_QL-ENJM)",

It gives organizations the ability to support strategic business decisions. \n\n    In a nutshell, this practice involves collecting data from different data sources, cleaning data to remove errors, and then applying different techniques to find patterns and identify anomalies. While the role of data analysts might be often confused with data scientists, those roles are not exactly the same.\n\n    By using tools like data visualization and techniques, such as creating charts with Power BI or Microsoft Excel, you can present data in a way that helps stakeholders interpret it and make informed decisions (this is what the industry calls “data-driven decisions”).\n\n    In essence, it’s all about using technical skills, different languages, and methods such as predictive modeling to analyze the data, predict future trends, and ultimately support the so-called data-driven insights.\n\n    ## What does a Data Analyst do?\n\n    A data analyst does many things, because the role itself is very versatile, it involves everything from collecting data to the presentation of findings (i.e. plotting results in charts, or presenting reports with found insights) and everything in between.\n\n    To be more specific, a data analyst's work revolves around collecting and gathering data from databases, spreadsheets, and other data sources (usually structured data sources). They perform data analysis by cleaning data and then applying techniques such as regression analysis, and data mining to model data. The final aim is to identify trends and predict outcomes.\n\n    With a strong foundation in both computer science and data science, they can use different programming languages and various tools to analyze data and generate reports or visualizations that support strategic decisions.\n\n    By the nature of their work, no matter if they’re finding anomalies, performing predictive analytics, or simply solving problems with data-driven insights, data analysts function at the intersection of tech skills (i.e. coding) and business intelligence (they can’t produce meaning results if they don’t understand the business), transforming an organization’s data into data-driven decisions.\n\n    ## What skills are required for Data Analysis?\n\n    There are several skills required for data analysis, and they’re all technical skills. Data analysts must start by getting a solid foundation in working with raw data. They then need the ability to ingest and collect data from different sources—be it through databases, spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, or specialized data collection tools.\n\n    Once you’ve gathered the data comes data cleaning. This means removing inconsistencies, errors, and outliers so that your data sets are accurate and reliable. Techniques like statistical analysis and data mining help you identify anomalies and ensure that you’re working with data that truly represents your problem universe.\n\n    With the clean data, the next logical step is to analyze it. This involves using several techniques, such as regression analysis, and statistical modeling to recognize patterns and trends. In the end, the end goal is to learn from the data and share those insights with the business.\n\n    When it comes to skills, understanding and having proficiency in languages such as Python or R, along with expertise in various tools like Power BI, are incredibly valuable here. They enable you to perform predictive modeling and even apply machine learning techniques when needed.\nseo:\n  title: 'Data Analyst Roadmap'\n  description: 'Learn to become an Data Analyst using this roadmap.
