    "what-are-mutations@9Q2pGidY-rfkltHq3vChp": "# What are Mutations\n\nMutations in GraphQL are operations used to modify data on the server - creating, updating, or deleting records. They're structured like queries but use the \"mutation\" field at the top level and include fields specifying the data to be changed and the operation type.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@official@Get started with Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/mutations/)\n",
    "what-are-queries@2SU4dcaz7zwGsF7g8FjmI": "# What are Queries\n\nIn GraphQL, queries are client requests to retrieve data from the server. They're structured as hierarchical trees of fields that correspond to the properties of the requested data, allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need in a predictable format.\n\nLearn more from following links:\n\n- [@official@Introduction of GraphQL - Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)\n",
    "what-are-subscriptions@RlBc-hWEUOPaEQLTgJa-K": "# What are Subscriptions\n\nSubscriptions in GraphQL enable real-time updates by allowing clients to subscribe to specific events or data changes on the server. They're structured like queries with a \"subscription\" field at the top level and push updates to clients as soon as events occur.\n\nTo learn more, visit the following links:\n\n- [@article@How GraphQL Subscriptions Work?](https://the-guild.dev/blog/subscriptions-and-live-queries-real-time-with-graphql)\n",
    "what-is-graphql@cMfsRtvzvDZZJ0TqeUOxm": "# What is GraphQL\n\nGraphQL is a query language for APIs and server-side runtime that lets clients request exactly the data they need. Unlike REST, it uses a type system to define data structure and allows fetching multiple resources in a single request, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching problems.\n\nTo learn more, visit the following links:\n\n- [@official@Introduction to graphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)\n- [@article@Tutorial - What is graphQL?](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/)\n- [@feed@Explore top posts about GraphQL](https://app.daily.dev/tags/graphql?ref=roadmapsh)\n"
