It provides a common interface for working with various types of data stores, including relational databases, NoSQL data stores, and cloud-based data services. The goal of Spring Data is to simplify data access in Spring applications by providing a consistent, high-level repository programming model across different data stores and data access technologies. This can help developers write less boilerplate code and focus on business logic, while still being able to take advantage of the full power of the underlying data store.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data)\n- [@article@Spring Data – One API To Rule Them All?](https://www.infoq.com/articles/spring-data-intro/)\n- [@article@What is JPA, Spring Data and Spring Data JPA](https://www.amitph.com/jpa-and-spring-data-jpa/)\n- [@feed@Explore top posts about Spring Framework](https://app.daily.dev/tags/spring?ref=roadmapsh)",
