Instead, it serves as a template or blueprint for other classes to inherit from. An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods (abstract methods are methods that do not have any implementation, they just have a signature).\n\nAbstract classes are used to provide a common interface and implementation for a group of related classes. They are also used to define common behavior that must be implemented by all subclasses. A subclass that inherits from an abstract class is called a concrete class, and it must provide an implementation for all the abstract methods declared in the parent class.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@article@What is an Abstract Class in Object Oriented Programming](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/abstract-class)\n",

An anemic model often results in the use of data-transfer objects (DTOs) and service layer to handle the behavior.\n\nAn anemic model is considered an anti-pattern in object-oriented programming (OOP) because it violates the principles of encapsulation and separation of concerns. In an anemic model, the behavior is separated from the data, and is typically implemented in a separate service layer, which can lead to a complex, tightly coupled, and hard-to-maintain codebase.\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@article@Overview of Anemic Domain Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model)\n",

Here are some ways to avoid passing nulls or Booleans in system architecture:\n\n- Use Optionals or Maybe types instead of nulls to indicate the absence of a value. This makes it clear when a value is missing and prevents null reference exceptions.\n- Use a default value for function arguments instead of allowing them to be null or Boolean. This eliminates the need to check for null or Boolean values and reduces the potential for errors.\n- Use the Null Object pattern to replace null values with a special object that has a defined behavior. This eliminates the need to check for null values and makes the code more readable.\n- Use the Ternary operator (?:) instead of if-else statements when working with Booleans.

    "minimize-cyclomatic-complexity@qZzl0hAD2LkShsPql1IlZ": "# Minimize Cyclomatic Complexity\n\nCyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of a program, which is determined by the number of linearly independent paths through a program's control flow. High cyclomatic complexity can make a program difficult to understand, test, and maintain, so it's often desirable to minimize it in system architecture.\n\nHere are some ways to minimize cyclomatic complexity in system architecture:\n\n- Break down complex functions into smaller, simpler functions that perform specific tasks.\n- Use control structures, such as if-else statements and loops, in a consistent and predictable way.\n- Use functional programming concepts and techniques, such as immutability and pure functions, to reduce the need for complex control flow.\n- Use design patterns, such as the state pattern, to simplify complex control flow.\n- Regularly review the code and refactor it to simplify the control flow.\n- Use static code analysis tools that can detect and report high cyclomatic complexity in the code.\n\nBy following these best practices, the system architecture will be more maintainable, testable, and less error-prone.\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@article@How to reduce cyclomatic complexity?](https://kasp9023.medium.com/how-to-make-your-code-more-readable-focus-on-the-happy-path-and-reduce-cyclomatic-complexity-66802b8897b5)\n",

The models represent the design of the system, and the code is generated from the models, which makes it easier to maintain and evolve the system.

This is achieved through method overloading, which allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters within the same class.\n- Run-time polymorphism (also called dynamic polymorphism or late binding) occurs when the type of the object is determined at run-time.

    "value-objects@Ks6njbfxOHiZ_TrJDnVtk": "# Value Objects\n\nValue Objects are a pattern used in enterprise application development to represent simple, immutable values that are used to model domain concepts. They are typically used to encapsulate data that is not an entity, but is important to the domain.\n\nA Value Object is defined by its value rather than its identity, meaning that two Value Objects with the same value are considered to be equal, regardless of their identity.\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@article@Overview - Implement Value Objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/implement-value-objects)\n- [@article@Intro to Value object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object)\n",
    "yagni@eEO-WeNIyjErBE53n8JsD": "# YAGNI\n\nYAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a software development principle that suggests that developers should not add functionality to a codebase unless it is immediately necessary. The idea is to avoid creating unnecessary complexity in the codebase by only adding features that are actually needed.\n\nThe YAGNI principle is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), which are part of the SOLID principles. YAGNI aims to keep the codebase as simple as possible by avoiding the creation of unnecessary abstractions and functionality.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:\n\n- [@article@YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) Principle Helps in Efficiency](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/yagni)\n- [@video@What is YAGNI coding rule, and Why it helps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vys1q1dKc4)\n"
