    "zoneless-applications@1x5pT607aKE-S-NCWB810": "# Zoneless Applications\n\nAngular 18 introduced an experimental feature called zoneless change detection. This technology removes the need for `Zone.js`, a library that was previously used for change detection in Angular from the beginning. By eliminating `Zone.js`, Angular applications can have faster initial renders, smaller bundle sizes, and simpler debugging.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Zoneless](https://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless)\n- [@article@Zoneless Change Detection Angular 18](https://blog.logrocket.com/zoneless-change-detection-angular-18/)\n- [@article@From Zone JS to Zoneless Angular and back: How it all works](https://angularindepth.com/posts/1513/from-zone-js-to-zoneless-angular-and-back-how-it-all-works)\n- [@article@A New Era for Angular: Zoneless Change Detection](https://justangular.com/blog/a-new-era-for-angular-zoneless-change-detection)\n- [@video@Zoneless Angular Applications in V18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ6s5EL7hKk)\n- [@video@I tested Angular 18 Zoneless mode and this is what I found out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHNeAqgNM4o)",

It captures asynchronous operations like setTimeout, network requests, and event listeners. Angular schedules change detection based on signals from Zone.js.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [@official@Resolving Zone Pollution](https://angular.dev/best-practices/zone-pollution)\n- [@official@Angular without ZoneJS (Zoneless)](https://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless)\n- [@official@NgZone - API](https://angular.dev/api/core/NgZone)\n- [@video@WTF is \"Zone.js\" and is it making your app slow?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmrf_gPIOZU)"
