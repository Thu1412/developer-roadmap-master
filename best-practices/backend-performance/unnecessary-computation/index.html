<p>Efficient backend performance in web applications is often determined by how well unnecessary processing or expensive computations are minimised on the server. When an application is free of excess processing or complex computations, it expends less energy, executes tasks swiftly, and reduces any potential downtime. This remarkably improves the application’s response time to user requests. For example, instead of calculating the same data repeatedly for different users, the application can calculate once, store the result, and then provide this stored result upon user request. This essentially minimises unnecessary processes, thereby enhancing the web application’s backend performance.</p>
